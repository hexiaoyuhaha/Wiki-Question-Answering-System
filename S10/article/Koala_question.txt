What happened in the early 20th century?
Do Koalas have a slow metabolism?
Did eucalypt forests grow in the place of rainforests?
Does the koala fill the same ecological role as the sloth of South America?
Is the long term viability of the koala therefore threatened by genetic weakness?
Is the koala found in coastal regions of eastern and southern Australia, from near Adelaide to the southern part of Cape York Peninsula?
Do populations also extend for considerable distances inland in regions with enough moisture to support suitable woodlands?
Were the koalas of South Australia largely exterminated during the early part of the 20th century, but the state has since been repopulated with Victorian stock?
